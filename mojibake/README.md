## Mojibake puzzle dictionary

Why solve a single crossword puzzle, when we can write a program to solve them all? Let's write such a program. In our case, the crosswords are multi-lingual. We start from a simple grid that is partially filled in, and we search through a dictionary for words that we could put in there. For example, let's start with this simple grid:
```
      |
   ...D...   (7)
    ..E..... (8)
     .L...   (5)
  ....F.     (6)
......T..    (9)
      |
```
Each horizontal line, you need to fill in a word of the right length, that matches the letter that is already filled in. There are no constraints on the vertical lines, i.e. the vertical lines do not have to form real words (apart from the one that is already filled in)1. To fill in the blanks, we need to search through a dictionary of words.

Your test input contains two parts. The first part is a list of words. Then follows a blank line, and then the second part contains the crossword, with periods (.) representing the letters that need to be filled in.
```
geléet
träffs
religiÃ«n
tancées
kÃ¼rst
roekoeÃ«n
skälen
böige
fÃ¤gnar
dardÃ©es
amènent
orquestrÃ¡
imputarão
molières
pugilarÃÂ£o
azeitámos
dagcrème
zÃ¶ger
ondulât
blÃ¶kt

   ...d...
    ..e.....
     .l...
  ....f.
......t..
```
But, there is a catch! Something weird is going on with the dictionary. If you look closely, you see that some of the words in this dictionary appear garbled. This character soup is typical when two programs disagree about the encoding of a piece of text. And this is exactly what happened during the compilation of this dictionary.

The Japanese, whose rich set of characters has created ample opportunities for message garbling, have dubbed this phenomenon mojibake.

All is not lost, however, because if the mistake is known, it could potentially be undone. In this case, there is a clear pattern.

The entire file is encoded as utf-8. Most words are correct with this encoding.
For every 3rd line, the original word was encoded in utf-8 but loaded by a system that expected latin-1 / ISO-8859-1. The resulting character mash was stored with utf-8 encoding.
The same has happened every 5th line.
Where the two series overlap (every 15th line), the word was doubly-miscoded.
Thus we can deduce that:

the 3rd word in the test-input should be religiën
the 5th word is kürst
the 6th word is roekoeën
etc. etc.
the 15th word is pugilarão
Scanning the test input for words that fit in our crossword, we can complete it like so:
```
      |     
   darDées   (7)
    roEkoeën (8)
     bLökt   (5)
  träfFs     (6)
orquesTrá    (9)
      |    
```
To arrive at your solution, take the line-number of each word in the original list, and add them together. So we add 10 + 6 + 20 + 2 + 12 and arrive at 50. This is the solution for the test problem.
