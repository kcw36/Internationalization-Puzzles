# Puzzle 4 - A trip around the world

The novel 'Around the world in 80 days', by Jules Verne, tells the story of Phileas Fogg, an eccentric Englishman who speedruns a trip around the world on a daring bet. He is accompanied by his servant Passepartout. The book was published in 1872. Like every good science fiction author, Jules Verne took ideas from the cutting edge of science at the time, and worked it into a thrilling story. And the new idea was this: that it was possible to notice the difference between time zones, something that was made possible by the mechanization of transport. Here is an excerpt from the book, where we see Passepartout being completely baffled by this effect:

"You have plenty of time; it's only twelve o'clock."

Passepartout pulled out his big watch. "Twelve!" he exclaimed; "why, it's only eight minutes before ten."

"Your watch is slow."

"My watch? A family watch, monsieur, which has come down from my great-grandfather! It doesn't vary five minutes in the year. It's a perfect chronometer, look you."

"I see how it is," said Fix. "You have kept London time, which is two hours behind that of Suez. You ought to regulate your watch at noon in each country."

"I regulate my watch? Never!"

"Well, then, it will not agree with the sun."

"So much the worse for the sun, monsieur. The sun will be wrong, then!"

Those time differences lead to a major plot twist. Go read the book to find out...

Suppose you follow a similar round-the-world itinerary. This itinerary is your puzzle input. It lists a sequence of departures and arrivals, starting from London, taking you around the world, and back again to London. You travel from place to place by airplane or high-speed train. For each place, the name of the continent is listed as well (in case you need to brush up your topography). As is the habit of airlines and travel agencies, all arrival and departure times are printed in local time.

Write a program that calculates the total travel time in minutes, of the input itinerary. How many minutes would you be spending inside a train or airplane?
